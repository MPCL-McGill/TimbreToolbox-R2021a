# TimbreToolbox-R2021a

The Timbre Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for computing audio descriptors. 

It was originally developed by Peeters et al. (2011) and is described in:

Peeters, G., Giordano, B.L., Susini, P., Misdariis, N. & McAdams, S. (2011). The Timbre Toolbox: Extracting audio descriptors from musical signals. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 130, 2902-2916. 

Since then, it has undergone many revisions, and many computations of the descriptors described in the original paper have changed. See the reference manual for details.

## Compatibility with MATLAB versions

R2020a, R2020b, R2021a

Older MATLAB versions have not been tested. 

## Dependencies

The Timbre Toolbox R-2021a requires MATLAB’s Signal Processing Toolbox.

## Installation

Download the toolbox either using git or clicking on the "Download ZIP" link.

If the file is downloaded through the "Download ZIP" link, decompress the archive to some location (e.g. in Documents > MATLAB) and RENAME the decompressed folder to: TimbreToolbox-R2021a

Add the folder to MATLAB’s path, e.g., by using the MATLAB browser: select the folder, right-click on it (now that it is highlighted) and select Add to Path -> Selected Folders and Subfolders.

## Usage
Examples on how to run the toolbox can be found inside the Documentation folder. 
A GUI is also available.
